            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, 
            for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may
            accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>

            <h2>1 Nephi 5:21</h2>
            <p>And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded us, and searched them and found that they were desirable;
            yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.
